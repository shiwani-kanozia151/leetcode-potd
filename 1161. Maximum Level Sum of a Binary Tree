1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

Example 2:
Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

APPROACH:
It's basically level order traversal but here we need to find the sum of each level and have to return the height of the tree that have the maximum sum of that level.

CODE:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        int height = 1;
        int maxh = 1;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            int sum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* temp = q.front();
                q.pop();

                sum += temp->val;

                if (temp->left != NULL)
                    q.push(temp->left);

                if (temp->right != NULL)
                    q.push(temp->right);
            }

            if (sum > maxi) {
                maxi = sum;
                maxh = height;
            }

            height++;
        }

        return maxh;
    }
};
