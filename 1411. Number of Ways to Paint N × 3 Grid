1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent
cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

APPROACH: Need to go through this video again to get the final touch..

CODE: 

class Solution {
public:
    int M = 1e9 + 7;
    vector<vector<int>> t;
    
    string states[12] = {
        "RYG", "RGY", "RYR", "RGR", "YRG", "YGR",
        "YGY", "YRY", "GRY", "GYR", "GRG", "GYG"
    };

    int solve(int n, int prev)
    {
        if (n == 0) return 1;

        if (t[n][prev] != -1)
            return t[n][prev];

        int result = 0;
        string last = states[prev];

        for (int curr = 0; curr < 12; curr++)
        {
            if (curr == prev) continue;

            string currpattern = states[curr];

            bool conflict = false;

            for (int col = 0; col < 3; col++)
            {
                if (currpattern[col] == last[col])
                {
                    conflict = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!conflict)
                result = (result + solve(n - 1, curr)) % M;
        }

        return t[n][prev] = result;
    }

    int numOfWays(int n)
    {
        t.resize(n + 1, vector<int>(12, -1));

        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
        {
            result = (result + solve(n - 1, i)) % M;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
